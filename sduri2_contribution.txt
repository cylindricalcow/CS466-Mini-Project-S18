I wrote the text of the project proposal document which was submitted a few weeks ago. In that proposal, I wrote the goal, data and data analysis section after we chose the path we wanted to proceed down, and after we discussed at a high level what our project aimed to look into. I wrote the data analysis section based on feedback we received via a private Piazza post regarding what type of information would be required for our project (if we were comparing algorithms).

I investigated (in code form) the applicability of Minibatch K-Means for our project, but we came to the conclusion that it didn't really stand apart from K-means itself and so we did not include it in the final report. I also looked into determining the source of some NaN issues in the preprocessing code that Jonathan wrote but was unable to come to a conclusion.

I wrote our project report document, using the data and charts we generated. I wrote the document text based on these charts, and wrote the analysis and conclusion sections' text. Of course, as with any project with multiple people all focusing on different aspects, I did not write the text without detailed and thorough discussion with others, but the text is (or is nearly entirely) my wording.
